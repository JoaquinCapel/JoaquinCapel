## A Little Bit of My Story

With a solid 23-year track record at the same company, I have developed a reputation as a committed, stable, and loyal employee. During this time, I faced significant challenges, especially during new product launches where teamwork was crucial. In these situations, I actively contributed and played an essential role in achieving goals under intense pressure.

However, my true passion lies at the intersection of creativity and technology. My fascination with programming, the audiovisual world, and multimedia content led me to take a decisive turn in my career. After exploring music production and video creation through various courses, I decided to pursue what I am truly passionate about: programming.

In 2016, I decided to start my Bachelor's Degree in Communication at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, where I had my first encounter with the world of programming. Years later, I chose to invest more time and effort to become a Front-End Developer at the IT Academy of Barcelona Activa.

My current goal is to continue expanding my knowledge in the programming sector, merging my solid experience with the renewed passion I discovered a few years ago. I am ready to prove my worth and significantly contribute to innovative projects.
